**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

I learnt basic html and css and how to style a document

```html
<div>
  <img id="mockup" src="./images/illustration-mockups.svg" />
  <h1 id="head">
    Build the community <br /><span class="break">your fans will love</span>
  </h1>
  <br />
  <p>
    Huddle re-imagines the way we build communities. You have a voice, but so
    does your audience. Create connections with your users as you engage in
    genuine discussion.
  </p>
</div>
```

```css
button {
  background-color: white;
  border: none;
  font-size: 16px;
  font-family: "Open Sans" sans-serif;
  width: 200px;
  height: 40px;
  margin: 20px auto;
  padding: 10px 20px;
  border-radius: 20px;
  color: hsl(257, 40%, 49%);
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  text-align: center;
  box-shadow: 0px 10px 10px rgba(19, 18, 18, 0.541);
}
```

```
